## 📥 Required Model Files

This workflow uses the **wan2.2-t2v-rapid-aio-v10-nsfw GGUF** model from [Phr00t/befox rapid merge](https://huggingface.co/befox/WAN2.2-14B-Rapid-AllInOne-GGUF).

### Important Naming Note
The "D" prefix you may see in some screenshots (e.g., `Dwan2.2-t2v-rapid-aio-v10-nsfw-Q3_K.gguf`) is just my local folder organization. **Download files with their original names** as shown below - ComfyUI will load them correctly from the standard model folders.

---

### 1. Main Model (GGUF) - Choose based on your VRAM

**Repository:** https://huggingface.co/befox/WAN2.2-14B-Rapid-AllInOne-GGUF/tree/main/v10

### Quick Tips
- Verify file hashes after download (Hugging Face shows them on each file page)
- If links change, search Hugging Face for "WAN2.2-14B-Rapid-AllInOne-GGUF" (befox), "umt5-xxl-encoder-gguf" (city96), or "Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged" (Comfy-Org)
- **For best low-VRAM performance:** Use Q3_K or Q4_K model + Q3_K_M CLIP + standard Wan VAE

### Recommended Configurations by VRAM

| VRAM | Main Model | Text Encoder | Total Memory | Performance |
|------|------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 6GB  | Q3_K       | Q3_K_M       | ~11GB system | Fast, good quality |
| 8GB  | Q4_K       | Q3_K_M       | ~13GB system | Balanced ⭐ |

## 🎬 How to Use

### Basic Workflow

1. **Load the workflow** in ComfyUI
2. **Set your parameters:**
   - Width: 512 (default)
   - Height: 512 (default)
   - Seconds: 10 (duration of video)
   - FPS: 15 (frames per second)
   - *Frames are calculated automatically!*
3. **Choose mode:**
   - Text-to-Video (t2v): Generate from text prompt
   - Image-to-Video (i2v): Animate from input image
4. **Enter your prompt** (positive and negative)
5. **Queue prompt** and generate!

### Text-to-Video (t2v) Mode

1. Make sure "Load Image" node is **disabled/muted**
2. Enter your text prompt describing the video
3. Queue prompt

### Image-to-Video (i2v) Mode

1. **Enable** the "Load Image" node
2. Load your input image
3. Enter your prompt (can enhance/modify the image animation)
4. Queue prompt

### Last Frame Extraction (Optional)

The workflow includes automatic last frame saving for video chaining:

- **Enabled by default** - Last frame is automatically saved
- **To disable:** Mute the "Save the Last Frame" group using rgthree Group Muter
- **Use case:** Chain multiple generations together for longer videos

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Features Explained

### Automatic Frame Calculation
- Input: FPS × Seconds
- Calculation: `(FPS × Seconds) + 1`
- The +1 frame is required for Wan's t2v initialization
- Works for both t2v and i2v modes automatically

### Memory Optimization
- GGUF quantization reduces model size
- Aggressive CPU offloading (~9GB offloaded to system RAM)
- Dynamic memory management between pipeline stages
- Memory cleanup nodes for low-VRAM systems

### Mode Switching
- Clean interface with POS/NEG/Switch nodes
- One control point switches both two paths (Text2Image and Image2Video) simultaneously
- No manual rewiring needed between modes

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Out of Memory" Errors
- Drop to Q3_K model instead of Q4_K
- Close other applications to free system RAM
- Enable Windows page file (set to system managed)
- Reduce video length (fewer seconds)

### "Missing Nodes" Error
- Install all required custom nodes (see list above)
- Use ComfyUI Manager's "Install Missing Nodes" feature
- Restart ComfyUI after installing nodes

### GGUF Models Not Loading
- Ensure ComfyUI-GGUF is installed correctly
- Verify model files are in correct folders with exact filenames
- Check that files downloaded completely (verify file sizes)

### Poor Quality Output
- Try Q4_K or Q5_K model if you have more VRAM
- Increase steps (though 4 steps works well with this model)
- Adjust prompt strength and detail
- Use better quality input images for i2v mode

### Slow Generation
- This is normal for low-VRAM setups (CPU offloading takes time)
- Expected: ~5 minutes for 1 second video on RTX 3050 6GB
- Close background applications
- Ensure models are on SSD for faster loading

---

## 🎯 Performance Benchmarks

### RTX 3050 6GB (Tested Configuration)
- **Model:** Q4_K + Q3_K_M CLIP
- **Video length:** 1 second (16 frames @ 15 FPS)
- **Total time:** ~4.6 minutes
  - Model loading: ~1 min
  - Sampling (4 steps): ~1.8 min
  - VAE decode: ~30s
- **Quality:** Good, suitable for most use cases

### Expected Performance on Other Cards
- **RTX 3060 12GB:** ~3 minutes (less offloading overhead)
- **RTX 4060 8GB:** ~2.5 minutes (faster architecture)
- **RTX 4070 12GB:** ~2 minutes (minimal offloading)

*Times are approximate and depend on system configuration*

## 📝 Optional: NSFW Content Unlocker

The workflow includes an optional NSFW unlocker LoRA that is **disabled by default**.

### DR34ML4Y_I2V_14B_LOW_V2.safetensors (Optional LoRA)
- **Purpose:** Removes content filters for adult content generation
- **NOT required for normal usage**
- **Strength:** 0.6 (model) / 0.6 (clip) when enabled
- **To disable:** Mute the "Load LORA" node or set strength to 0

⚠️ The workflow works perfectly for normal SFW content generation without this LoRA.
